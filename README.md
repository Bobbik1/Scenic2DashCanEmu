# A lowcost DIY CAN bus emulator for Renault Scenic 2 dashboard repair

This code is an adapted version of the original
[UNO+MCP515](https://github.com/dirksan28/Scenic2DashCanEmu) based project by
@dirksan28 for an ESP32 board with a CAN transceiver (e.g. SN65HVD230).

## Features
- build to test your Renault Scenic 2 dashboard after and during repair
- powers up your dashboard without the need of installation in the car
- large test sequence. Shows saved km/milage on startup. (see video)
- if connected to a serial console: timestamp and message logging on screen
- standalone operation (only with charging adapter) possible

## What you need
- an ESP32 board (any ESP32 board should work, tested with a basic [esp32 dev kit](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html) board)
- a CAN transceiver module (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/s?k=SN65HVD230 or https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&SearchText=SN65HVD230+arduino) Make sure to choose one that have a 120â„¦ termination resistor.
- The platformio embedded developement framework (cli or IDE) https://platformio.org to compile and upload the sketch to the ESP32.

## Hardware

### Wireing
#### ESP32 <-> VP230
| PIN on ESP21 | PIN on VP230 CAN Bus Breakout Board  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| D21 | CTX |
| D22 | CRX |
| 3V3 | 3V3 |
| GND | GND |

To work properly, make sure the CAN bus termination resistor is populated.

#### The dashboard
|PIN# (grey connector on dash)| meaning |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| 1                           | +12V    |
| 2                           | GND     |
| 29                          | CAN LOW |
| 30                          | CAN HI  |

##### Hint
The dash takes about 4-5 amps peak current (filament heating, caps) when it starts up.
Especially when using small current limiting lab power supplies this may become a thing.
Make sure your power supply and cabling is sufficient.

The Message-Sequence can be extended or modified by patching the following code
fragments within the [canEmulator.ino](./src/canEmulator.ino "link to canEmu.ino") file:

### Code
```c
/**
 * the following stuct contains the messages which are send to the dash
 * for initialization
 * feel free to add or remove messages.
 * {duration, id, dlc {byte1, byte2, ... byte_dlc}}
**/
const struct msgStruct initMessages[] PROGMEM = {
   {10, 0x35d, 8, { 0x10, 0x03, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x50, 0x00}}   //dash on
  ,{4, 0x60d, 8, { 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x27, 0x73, 0x21, 0x71}}    //reset displ state
...
};

/**
 * the following stuct contains the messages which are send to the dash
 * within a loop
 * feel free to add or remove messages.
 * {duration, id, dlc {byte1, byte2, ... byte_dlc}}
**/
const struct msgStruct messages[] PROGMEM = { //load into flash-memory (sram was to small)
  {1, 0x743, 8, {0x02, 0x10, 0xC0, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}}  //enable indicators

## Current state
The code was tested on a V5.14 dashbord and runs fine.

## Design principles
- keep it stupid simple
- even "non-arduino experts" should be able to use and set up the project easily
- keep dependencies as few as possible (e.g. libraries, source files, additional hardware, ...)
- adaptable and expandable even without knowledge of C / C ++

## Collection of ideas
- Read the CAN messages from an external SD card (thus support for different dashboards without having to compile the code)
- single step mode (possibly forwards and backwards) via an additional button
- PCB layout for a self containing, single board solution

## Known issues
- CAN message to activate the lightbulb symbol is currently unknown  ![](./pics/missingBulbInd.png)
